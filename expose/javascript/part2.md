Part 2:
1. It will log the value of i when the for loop concludes which will be 3.
2. It will log the value of discountedPrice whne the for loop concludes which will be its most recent value of 150.
3. It will log the final discounted price of the last price in the array which will be 150.
4. The function will return an array of the discounted prices which will be [50,100,150] in this case. This is because discounted is returned and discounted was initialized as an empty array. Each iteration of the for loop pushed the discountedPrice to this array.
5. It will cause an error because i is only defined and usable in the for loop because it was defined by let in the for loop.
6. It will cause an error because discountedPrice is only defined and usable in teh for loop because it was defined by let in the for loop.
7. It will log the final discounted price of the last price in the array which will be 150.
8. This will return an array of the discounted prices which will be [50,100,150] in this case. All the variables in this case will have been properly used in their scope so it wil output an array as explained in part 2 question 4.
9. This will cause an error because i is only defined and usable in the for loop because it was defined by let in the for loop.
10. This will log the size of the prices array which will be 3.
11. This will return an array of the discounted prices which will be [50,100,150] in this case. All the variables are properly used in their scope and the const variables are not being reassigned values. The discounted array will properly keep track of the discounts and will be returned by the function.
12. A. student.name
B. student['Grad Year']
C. student.greeting()
D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
E. student.courseLoad[0]  

13. A. '32'
The 2 is converted to a string and both strings are concatenated.
B. 1
The 3 is converted to a number and the two numbers are subtracted.
C. 3
The null is converted to a the number 0 and then added to 3.
D. '3null'
The null is converted to string and both string are concatenated.
E. 4
The true becomes the number 1 and is added to 3.
F. 0
Both the false and the null are converted to a 0 then added together.
G. '3undefined'
The undefined is converted to a string and both strings are concatenated.
H. NaN
The undefined is converted to NaN which results in the entire statement being NaN.  

14. A. true
The '2' is turned into the number 2 which is indeed greater than the number 1.
B. false
The two strings are first compared by first character of each string first. '2' has a greater ascii value than '1' so '2' < '12' will be false.
C. true
The '2' is turned into the number 2 which is equal to the number 2.
D. false
The '2' in this case is not turned into a number and stays a string which is not equal to the number 2.
E. false
The true is converted to the number 1 which is not equal to the number 2.
F. true
Boolean(2) will output the boolean true which is equal to the boolean true.  

15. The === operator will return false when comparing different types while == will do a type conversion before comparing.

17. The result will be the array that was passed in but with all its values multipled by 2 which will be [2,4,6]. The doSomething function was defined to return double the number that is inputted. This function is then passed in and used by the modifyArray function. The modifyArray function uses doSomething on each value of the original array and pushes it to a new array before returning the new array.
